# Overview

For your final project, you will design and present an AI solution relevant to your work, research or personal life, building on at least two modules from this course. You will deliver a **4- minute live presentation** and submit your slide deck.

We recommend that your project should use *at least two* different modules of the course:

-   **Websites, documents and presentations** (Week 1)
-   **Data analytics** (Week 2)
-   **Deep research and text analysis** using LLMs (Week 3)
-   **Chatbots/agents** (Week 4)
-   **Automation workflows** (Week 5)
-   **Designs, images and videos** (Week 6)

# Instructor Feedback Sessions

Our second-to-last workshop will be an optional session where you can get feedback and mentorship on your final project. Try to make sure you have at least a draft of the presentation by then.

# Presentation Dates

The presentation will be on either Sunday, November 30, 5pm GMT or Wednesday, December 3, 3pm GMT. You will be expected to present in your corresponding class time, which you have been attending. If you need to switch, please let us know with at least one week's notice.

# Submission Instructions

1.  **Prepare your slide deck** (PDF, PPTX or HTML) We recommend that your presentation should include the following sections, with these recommended (approximate) durations:
    -   The problem or opportunity addressed (30 seconds)
    -   Your solution and workflow (Live demonstration, screenshots or short video) (60 seconds)
    -   Key features and AI tools used (60 seconds)
    -   Discussion of current limitations and opportunities for improvement (60 seconds)
2.  **Present live** in your assigned session (4 minutes)
3.  **Upload your slide deck** to the submission page.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## **How do I prove I used an AI tool during the project?**

“Work on problems that used to be impossible, but are now really hard.” — Kevin Scott, Chief Technology Officer, Microsoft (2024)

While lots of people are trying to prove they *didn't* use AI in their work, we actually want to see that you *did* use it! This can be tricky to show, especially for things like data analysis where you could have done it all yourself. Here's how to handle this:

1.  **Keep Track**: Take some screenshots or short videos of you working with AI tools, like keeping receipts to show what you did!

2.  **Show the Difference**: Show how it helped you do more than you could have done on your own. The CEO of Microsoft, Kevin Scott, said this: “Work on problems that used to be impossible, but are now really hard.” Apply this to your project. Build a project that you would not have been able to achieve (at least not within two weeks) without the help of AI tools.

## **Can I use AI tools not covered in the course?**

Yes! While you should use at least one tool covered in the course, you're encouraged to explore additional AI tools that enhance your project.

## **What if my project doesn't work perfectly?**

That's completely fine and expected! Part of the reflection component is discussing what didn't work well. Failed experiments and limitations are valuable learning experiences.

## **Can I present preliminary results or a work-in-progress?**

It's okay if your work is not finished by the end of the course. Be clear about what's preliminary and what your next steps would be.

## **How strict is the 4-minute time limit?**

We'll aim for 4-5 minutes total to allow for brief Q&A. Practice your timing to ensure you cover all key points effectively.

## **Can I use the same data/project from another course?**

Yes, but you must add significant AI components that weren't part of your original work. The focus should be on the AI enhancement/integration.

## **What if I miss the feedback session?**

The feedback sessions are optional but highly recommended. If you can't attend, you can reach out via email or during regular office hours for guidance.
