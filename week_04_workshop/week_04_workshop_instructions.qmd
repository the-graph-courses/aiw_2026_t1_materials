## Introduction

Welcome! In this assignment, you'll create an LLM-powered chatbot using Botpress and embed it into your portfolio website that you created in a previous session.

Your completed chatbot will be able to:

1.  **Answer CV/Resume Questions** - Provide information about your background using uploaded CV data
2.  **Share Course Information** - Provide info about the Graph Courses GenAI syllabus and curriculum details\
3.  **Collect Visitor Information** - Gather names and emails from interested visitors for showcase day registration

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Part 1: Setting Up Your Botpress Account and Creating Your Bot

Our first task is to set up a Botpress account and create a new bot.

Note that Botpress interface changes from time to time, so the screenshots may not be exactly the same as the ones in the instructions.

Also note that the free account will allow your chatbots to send/receive up to 500 messages. This should be enough for our course chatbots. But for serious use later on, you may need to add credit to your account)

1.  **Create Your Botpress Account:**

    -   Go to [botpress.com](https://botpress.com/)

    -   Sign up for a free account using your email.

    -   Verify your email address if needed. (Botpress will send you a verification email to your inbox.)

    -   When you first sign up, you may be taken to a screen like the below asking whether you want to "build with AI" or let the Botpress team build for you. Select "build with AI".

        ![](images/build_with_ai.jpg){width="331"}

    -   You will then see a "Setup" screen. This is not needed. We will set up our bot from scratch. Click on "Skip" at the top right.

    ![](images/skip_setup.jpg){width="536"}

2.  **Open the Bot Studio:**

    -   You will now be brought to your bot's homepage. To open the bot studio, click on the "Edit in Studio" button at the top right.

    ![](images/edit_in_studio.jpg){width="545"}

    -   At this point, botpress may try to get you to sign up for a paid plan. Ignore this either by pressing Escape on the keyboard, or by clicking outside of the pop-up.

# Part 2: Setting Up the Bot Instructions

You now need to give an agent prompt that the LLM will use as context to understand how it should behave.

1.  **Set Bot Instructions:**

    -   In the main configuration area, find the "Instructions" field

    ![](images/bot_instructions.jpg)

    -   Enter instructions like the below:

```{text}
You are a portfolio assistant for a Generative AI course student. Your main tasks are:

- Answer questions about the student's CV and background using the knowledge base
- Provide information about the Graph Courses GenAI syllabus and curriculum based on your knowledge base
- After answering the user's query, politely ask them whether they might be interested in our upcoming showcase event. These take place on 

-  Sunday, November 30, 5pm GMT
-  Wednesday, December 3, 3pm GMT

- If they express interest, collect their name and email for registration and record those in the Attendees table tool.
- Try to be helpful while staying focused on these core topics. For other topics, politely decline to answer. 
```

# Part 3: Set up the Knowledge Base

Our next task is to set up a knowledge base for the bot to use to answer questions. As long as the knowledge we provide is not too long (not over the LLM's context window limit), the bot will be able to use it proficiently to answer questions.

1.  **Navigate to Knowledge Base:**
    -   Find the "Knowledge Base" section under the "Instructions" section
    -   Drag and drop your CV into the upload box. (If you don't want any of your personal information online, you can use a fake example CV from the internet, like here: <https://www.careers.ox.ac.uk/files/traditional-cv-examplepdf>)
    -   Download the syllabus from: <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NV-Mo2UgXQwdTu_Jv-HtCVnB9Pf2Grng/view>, and upload it to the knowledge base.

# Part 4: Set Up Data Collection

Next, we will create a table to store the data of the attendees of the showcase event.

1.  **Create Attendees Table Structure:**

    -   On the Botpress sidebar, click on the Tables icon.

    ![](images/tables_icon.jpg)

    -   Click on the New Table button at the top left and call it something like "Attendees", then click to Save.

    ![](images/new_table.jpg){width="346"}

    -   Click the new column icon to add the following two columns, leaving all settings as default
        -   Name
        -   Email

    ![](images/new_column_icon.jpg)

2.  **Configure Collection:**

Now, we have created the table, we need to tell the bot when and how to use this tool to store data.

-   Return to the main configuration area, by clicking on the "Main" icon on the left sidebar

![](images/main_icon.jpg)

-   Scroll down to the Tools section

![](images/tools_section.jpg){width="436"}

-   Click on Tables then the Attendees table, then "Create Rows". This gives your bot the ability to create rows in that table.

# Part 5: Testing and Publishing Your Bot

1.  **Use the Test Chat:**

    -   The Botpress interface has a test chat panel on the right side of the screen
    -   Try asking questions about:
        -   Your background ("Tell me about the educational background of \[your name\]")
        -   Course content ("What topics are covered in the GenAI course?")
    -   The bot should interrupt at some point to ask if you might be interested in the event.
    -   Give your email and name, then check the Attendees table to see if the bot was successful in adding your information.

2.  **Publish:**

    -   Click "Publish" button in the top-right corner
    -   Wait for the publishing process to complete

3.  **Get Embedding Code:**

    -   After publishing, click on the "Chat Bubble" icon under the Publish menu.
    -   You'll be taken to a section where you can edit the chat bubble settings.
    -   Next, navigate to the "Share" menu and copy the code under "Embed Code"

    ![](images/embed_code.jpg){width="613"}

# Part 6: Embedding Your Bot on Your Website

Now, we need to add this code to your portfolio website, so that a chat bubble appears at the bottom right of the page.

## Part 6A: Add Bot to Your Portfolio

1.  **Access Your GitHub Repository:**
    -   Go to your GitHub Pages repository where your portfolio is hosted
    -   Open the `index.html` file for editing
2.  **Insert the Bot Code:**
    -   Next, add the Webchat embed code to the head section of your website’s HTML. For example:

        ![](images/head_section.jpg){width="456"}

    -   If you do not feel comfortable making this change yourself, you can ask an LLM to do it for you.
3.  **Commit and Deploy:**
    -   Save your changes to the `index.html` file
    -   Commit the changes to your GitHub repository
    -   Your live site will update automatically (this may take 3-5 minutes)
    -   You can track the status of your deployment by clicking on the "Actions" tab in the menu of the GitHub repository page
    -   NOTE: Even after the site is done deploying, you may need to refresh the page a few times to see the bot appear, because your browser may be loading a cached version of the page.

## Part 6B: Test Live Integration

1.  **Visit Your Live Site:**
    -   Go to your GitHub Pages URL
    -   Look for the chat bubble (usually appears in the bottom-right corner)
2.  **Test Full Functionality:**
    -   Try the same tests you did before, but now on your live website
    -   Ensure the bot loads properly and responds correctly
    -   Verify the registration flow works in the live environment
3.  **Making changes to your bot:**
    -   WATCH OUT: If you make any changes to your bot, be sure to click on "Publish" again in the top-right corner to save your changes.

# Part 8: Submission

To submit:

-   Upload a screenshot of your chatbot ‘in action’ on the graph courses website in the upload box.
-   Paste a link to your website in the comments section.
